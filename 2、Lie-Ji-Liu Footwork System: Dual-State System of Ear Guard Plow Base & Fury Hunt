# Lie-Ji-Liu Footwork System: Dual-State System of Ear Guard Plow Base & Fury Hunt

## Overall Framework

Ear Guard Plow Base and Fury Hunt form a **dual-state footwork system**:

- **Ear Guard Plow Base: Stable State (Control State)**  
  Focuses on distance control, line control, and tempo control, using footwork to create conditions for defense, counterattack, and inducing mistakes.

- **Fury Hunt: Explosive State (Forcing State)**  
  Focuses on closing distance, seizing tempo, and forcing reactions, using footwork to directly change the engagement state.

> **Fundamental Difference:** Not about "posture," but whether footwork is used to "maintain the situation" or to "force a decisive outcome."

## I. Tactical Function Classification of Footwork

### 1. Measure Control

| Function | Purpose | Specific Manifestation |
|----------|---------|---------------------|
| **Entering attack range** | Decide when "this exchange begins" | Safe approach, pressuring step, probing step, angle-cut step |
| **Exiting attack range** | Decide when "this exchange ends" | Step back to evade, feigned retreat to bait, proactive withdrawal |
| **Critical-distance positioning** | Make opponent "want to strike but cannot" | Just out of reach, one step away from hit, opponent must overcommit if striking |

### 2. Tempo Control

| Function | Purpose | Specific Manifestation |
|----------|---------|---------------------|
| **Seizing tempo** | Enter before opponent is ready | Opponent changing stance → you step forward, opponent hesitates → you advance half-step to force decision |
| **Delaying tempo** | Let opponent make mistakes first | Slight retreat, pause, hover-step |
| **Creating secondary tempo** | Disrupt opponent's rhythm | Feint forward → pause → advance again, advance → retract → step forward again |

### 3. Line & Angle Control

- **Change attack lines:** forward + lateral step → attacks no longer linear  
- **Force opponent rotation:** make opponent turn shoulders/hips, lengthening reaction chain  
- **Block opponent’s step axis:** stand along opponent’s footwork axis, weakening their base  

### 4. Defensive Tactics

> **Core Concept:** Defend with footwork, not just with the sword

- Half-step back to evade a cut, sidestep to let thrusts miss  
- Retreat while advancing the sword, sidestep into opponent’s blind spot  
- **Goal:** Defense = Counterattack, not block-then-react  

### 5. Provocation & Deception

- **Induce attacks:** slow retreat, pause at opponent's "ideal striking distance"  
- **Induce footwork errors:** feint retreat to bait, cut lines to misplace steps  
- **Irregular tempo:** stop-move-stop, making opponent unpredictable  

### 6. Structural Breaking

- **Disrupt opponent stance:** force cross-steps, force leaning back  
- **Force disadvantageous stance changes:** attack during opponent’s stance transition  

### 7. Continuation & Chase

- **Support continuous strikes:** each strike supported by a step, maintaining distance  
- **Chase retreat:** opponent steps back → you advance in sync, angle to pursue  

### 8. HEMA Rules Adaptation & Competition Strategy

- **Reduce double-hit risk:** retreat immediately after attack, lateral exit instead of direct charge  
- **Control referee vision:** clear in/out, stable stance after strike

## II. Ear Guard Plow Base Footwork System (Stable State)

### Basic Step Types

| Step Type | Function | Tactical Intent |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| **Small forward/back steps** | Fine control of distance, enter/exit critical range | Distance control, tempo delay, induce strike |
| **Diagonal forward adjustment (front foot leading)** | Correct line, open attack angle without overextending | Avoid strong lines, block thrust line, create safe counter-angle |
| **Diagonal backward adjustment** | Exit linear attack, retain counter window | Defensive footwork, counter within defense, reduce double-hit risk |
| **Lateral step** | Change relative position, force opponent rotation or stance change | Disrupt structure, block footwork axis, create tempo break |
| **Retreat/sidestep for counter** | Evade attack while countering immediately | Defense = Counterattack, leverage opponent overextension |

### Provocation & Tempo Steps

- **Slow retreat:** bait attacks or premature actions (induce errors, create first-strike counter)  
- **Pause/hover step:** break rhythm, create psychological pressure (disrupt tempo, force early reaction)  
- **Short bow-step:** seize clear hitting window (principle: no pursuit, no chained rush)  

### Ear Guard Plow Base Principle

> **Maintain structure, keep sword on line, any step can immediately counter or retreat**

Tactical intents realized by Ear Guard Plow Base footwork: distance control, line control, tempo control, inducing mistakes, defensive counterattack, safe disengagement.

## III. Fury Hunt Footwork System (Explosive State)

### Core Step Types

| Step Type | Function | Tactical Intent |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| **Forward passing step** | Force entry into attack range, compress opponent’s reaction time | Seize tempo, create first-strike advantage (Vor), force response |
| **Diagonal forward passing step (rear foot leading)** | Close distance while avoiding central collision | Target weak line, reduce double-hit, disrupt structure |
| **Broken step / short pause** | Interrupt opponent’s rhythm | Induce errors, create secondary tempo |
| **Attack retreat / lateral retreat** | Exit immediately, prevent counters or double-hits | Safely end exchange, return to stable state |

### Fury Hunt Principle

> **Do not use Fury Hunt for prolonged dueling; avoid defending or greedy chaining**  

Fury Hunt footwork serves only three purposes: **close distance, seize tempo, force reaction**

## IV. Coordinated Use of Both Footwork Systems

### Standard Engagement Flow

1. **Ear Guard Plow Base:** control field & read opponent → detect window  
2. **Switch to Fury Hunt:** pressure or hit → immediately return to Ear Guard Plow Base  

### Division of Labor

- **Ear Guard Plow Base:** handles most tactical objectives – distance control, critical-range positioning, tempo delay, induce strikes, defensive counter  
- **Fury Hunt:** opens deadlocks – seize tempo, force distance, disrupt structure, quick decisive strikes  

### Ideal Signals to Switch into Fury Hunt

> Opponent shows slow retreat, hesitation in stance change, tempo broken by you, or stays at critical distance without initiative  

---

## V. Special Scenario: Right-Handed vs Left-Handed

### Core Principle

> **Use footwork to rebuild familiar engagement, not passively adapt**

### Key Adjustment Strategies

1. **Ear Guard Plow Base weaker on left side**, treat as transition zone, not main engagement zone  
2. Short diagonal or lateral step left to disrupt opponent strong line, force rotation  
3. **Do not stay on left under pressure**, immediately return to center or right  
4. Defensive counter: left diagonal backward step + controlling thrust to extend opponent’s line  
5. When switching to Fury Hunt, avoid central line clash, use **angled passing step to outside line**  

### Short Bow-Step Supplement

> Exception to "no pursuit, no chained rush": only follow through if opponent’s structure fully collapses, proceed with close-range follow-up  

---

## VI. Ultimate Summary

**Ear Guard Plow Base:** use footwork to control the field, wait for mistakes  
**Fury Hunt:** use footwork to force mistakes  
**Left-handed opponents:** not forbidden zone, must be navigated quickly as structural test  

> **Master’s Insight:**  
> Low-level swordsmen hit people, mid-level use techniques, high-level decide with footwork whether a strike will happen  

Footwork is never an isolated technique, it externalizes three things:  
1. Mastery of Vor/Indes (first-strike & immediate counter)  
2. Standing on the "correct line"  
3. Forcing opponent to act under "incomplete structure"

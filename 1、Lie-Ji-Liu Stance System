## Core Stances

### Ear Guard Plow Base — **Stable State**

**Core Purpose**  
The stable state is a fundamental combat posture focused on **line control, distance control, and reaction control**.  
It is not primarily offensive but maintains the potential for attack while prioritizing the setup of conditions for inducing, defending, and counterattacking.

**Form Characteristics**  
- **Lower Body:** Plow-style, low and stable, allowing continuous adjustment and adaptability  
- **Sword Point:** Directed at the opponent’s mid-to-lower line, prioritizing control of the middle and lower lanes  
- **Hand Position:** Close to the torso or ear, shortening sword path, enabling line control and transitions  
- **Posture:** Compact but flexible, can fine-tune structure with opponent’s movements  

**Functions & Advantages**  
- Excels at defensive counterattacks, especially mid-to-lower line control  
- Naturally counters leg feints and low-line cuts  
- Overhand strikes can intercept thrust lines; hanging positions can intercept cuts  
- Stable posture with minimal exposure, suitable as a base state for observation, probing, and initiating actions  

**Usage Logic**  
The stable state is not “absolutely safe,” but it offers high tolerance for mistakes in most distances and tempos.  
It does not rely on opponent errors but leverages structure and line control to force opponents to reveal intentions first.

### Fury Hunt Stance — **Explosive State**

**Core Purpose**  
The explosive state is a short-term, high-pressure posture for **initiating actions and interrupting tempo**.  
Its goal is not prolonged engagement but to create decisive advantages at critical moments.

**Form Characteristics**  
- **Lower Body:** Closest to a forward-passing step (“Passing Step”) posture  
- **Center of Gravity:** Significantly forward (~70%), actively shortening engagement distance  
- **Hand Position:** Forward (e.g., in front of the collarbone), compressing sword path  
- **Sword Point:** Angled forward-upward, ready for sudden forward thrusts  

**Functions & Features**  
- Gains speed advantage with minimal sword path  
- Suitable for close-range continuous pressure, forcing opponents into passive responses  
- Similar to some Fury-Thrust systems but trades raw power for speed  
- Structural integrity and technique compensate for lack of brute force  

**Usage Logic**  
Fury Hunt is not a default posture but a tool to change the pace or apply sudden pressure.  
Its value lies in **surprise**, not long-term maintenance.

> **Warning:** Avoid trading blows with a Fury-Thrust directly—disastrous consequences. Intervene in the tempo early, shortening the opponent’s time to complete a full strike, forcing them to respond before fully prepared.

## Overall Stance Switching Concept

- **Stable State** is the default posture for control, observation, and setting up counterattacks  
- **Explosive State** is a tactical tool for creating openings at key moments  
- Switching between them is essentially a **tempo choice**, not a mere comparison of posture superiority  

**Opponent Strategy**  
- Against aggressive / Fury-style opponents → Ear Guard Plow Base is safer  
- Against passive / delaying opponents → Fury Hunt is more effective  

**Core Philosophy**  
Ear Guard Plow Base serves as a structural anchor. Its goal is not directly to solve problems but to compress the situation via structure, then transition to a strong-line stance with minimal reaction cost, achieving defense or counterattack.

Three layers of structural advantage provided by Ear Guard Plow Base:  
1. **Sword point on line (mid-to-lower line)** → Short reaction path → Naturally intercepts thrusts and low cuts  
2. **Hands close to the body** → Short sword path → Quick transitions to Hanging, Longpoint, or Plow stances  
3. **Stable lower body (Plow stance)** → Steps can advance or retreat → Avoids catastrophic failure from a single mistake  

These advantages functionally **“react for you”**.

## Quick Reference Table: Ear Guard Plow Base → Other Stances

> **Ear Guard Plow Base = Stable Core**  
> **Other Stances = Functional Positions**  
> Switching is for: **response, pressure, termination**

---

### 1️⃣ Quick Plow (Pflug)

| Attribute | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Function** | Take control of mid-line, apply direct threat, force opponent reaction |
| **Switch Timing** | Opponent hesitates, sword tip wavers, mid-line temporarily open |
| **Switch Characteristics** | Sword tip stays on line, minimal hand movement |
| **Risk** | Standing still → opponent bypasses line; greedy thrust → high risk |
| **Role** | Converts “virtual threat” into “real threat” |

---

### 2️⃣ Ochs (Bull Stance)

| Attribute | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Function** | Upper-line control, leverage opponent’s force for counter |
| **Switch Timing** | Opponent applies pressure, raises hand to dominate upper line, or attempts to gain line control |
| **Switch Characteristics** | Follow opponent’s force, passive hand lift |
| **Risk** | Active switch → mid-line open; opponent thrusts straight |
| **Role** | Respond to opponent force, reap advantage |

---

### 3️⃣ Vom Tag (Roof Stance)

| Attribute | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Function** | Initiate attack, reset tempo, force defense |
| **Switch Timing** | Opponent retreats or hesitates, starting a new engagement |
| **Switch Characteristics** | Raise hand with forward pressure, or complete during opponent retreat |
| **Risk** | Slow raise → opponent strikes first; sword tip off-line too long |
| **Role** | “I am not waiting, I am striking” |

---

### 4️⃣ Hängen (Hanging Stance)

| Attribute | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Function** | Upper-line response, immediate counter (Indes) |
| **Switch Timing** | Opponent commits to high strike, hand visibly raised, attack trajectory clear |
| **Switch Characteristics** | Passive trigger, counter completed in same tempo |
| **Risk** | Active switch → mid-line open; vulnerable to straight thrust / low-line strike |
| **Role** | Opponent committed, you harvest opportunity |

---

### 5️⃣ Fury Hunt (Zornhut / Zorn-like)

| Attribute | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Function** | Apply pressure, dominate Vor, restrict opponent options |
| **Switch Timing** | Opponent retreats continuously, purely defensive, space is yours |
| **Switch Characteristics** | Must accompany forward pressure, sword tip enters threat zone first |
| **Risk** | Switch in place → straight thrust; insufficient pressure → high risk |
| **Role** | Opponent has no room left |

---

### 6️⃣ Longpoint

| Attribute | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Function** | Control distance, freeze tempo, deny exchanges |
| **Switch Timing** | Confused situation, opponent prone to reckless moves, need to reset |
| **Switch Characteristics** | Sword tip on line, no active attack |
| **Risk** | Loss of initiative, fails to bait opponent |
| **Role** | Safety valve, not primarily offensive |

---

### 7️⃣ Alber (Fool Stance)

| Attribute | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Function** | Explicitly bait opponent, lure low-line attacks |
| **Switch Timing** | Opponent extremely cautious, needs clear inducement |
| **Switch Characteristics** | Covered by Ear Guard Plow Base, low information density |
| **Risk** | Reveals intention, failed bait can lead to being pressured |
| **Role** | Clear lure, but not frequently used |

## Quick Mnemonic

> **Ear Guard Plow Base = Stable Start**  
> **Opponent moves → Ochs / Hanging**  
> **Opponent idle → Plow / Fury Hunt**  
> **Confused situation → Longpoint**  
> **Need to restart → Vom Tag**

# Lie-Ji-Ryu Swordsmanship · Student Progression Stages

> This document describes the three main stages of Lie-Ji-Ryu students, from beginner to master (non-zero starting point).  
> Focus is on identifying stage characteristics, clarifying training directions, and defining qualification criteria and keys to progression.

## Beginner Stage (Non-Zero Base)

### Stage Characteristics
The core issue at this stage is **lack of execution**:  
It’s not about “thinking incorrectly,” but **wanting to act correctly but failing to do so**.

Common signs:
- Slow, hesitant movements
- Unstable sense of distance
- Tendency to flail or overstrike under pressure

Main task: **establish controlled striking and withdrawal**, rather than deep strategic play.

### Training Focus
- Use **Ear-Guard Plow (Stable Stance)** as the observation base
- Focus on judging distance and opponent’s initial reactions
- Once judgment is clear, switch decisively to line-dominating stances (e.g., Anger Hunt, Long Point, Plow, Hanging) for offense
- Only combine **simple, direct defensive actions**
- Avoid psychological gambits or complex counterplay

Training priority: **bodily automation**, including:
- Footwork agility: forward, backward, lateral, stop
- Decisive actions: strike without obvious preparation
- Distance and line awareness: judge effective striking range
- Basic recognition of opponent’s bodily reactions

Key drill: after observing in Ear-Guard Plow, **decisively switch into line-dominating stances to compress the situation**.  
Goal: not hitting rate, but structural stability and fluid advance/retreat.

Recommended practice: mirror drills, shadow sword practice, slow partner drills; avoid high-pressure sparring; gradually remove hesitation and flailing under tension.

### Qualification Criteria
- Consistently execute full cycle: “Observe → Switch Stance → Force opponent reaction → Safe advance/retreat”
- No flailing under pressure
- Distance judgment remains stable

### Key to Progression
Develop basic **“sword intuition”**, realizing that opponent reactions follow repeatable patterns, naturally transitioning to **active control rather than passive execution**.

## Intermediate Stage

### Stage Characteristics
- Movements stabilize; no longer rush to strike first
- Develop awareness: “I don’t move yet, making you uncomfortable”
- Use stance, sword line, and rhythm to force opponent into **suboptimal actions**
- Perceived reactions become genuine, as line and distance control are established
- Defense and counter no longer rely on luck; structure supports action

### Training Focus
Focus on three core elements:
- Control the centerline
- Control distance
- Build basic defense and counter

Use position and sword lines to provoke predictable opponent reactions: **force worse choices**.

- Ear-Guard Plow remains structural foundation
- Combine tools like Anger Hunt for pressure and sword control drills
- Gradually introduce “strike first” principles
- Early phase emphasizes position and line control, avoiding blind pursuit of sword control actions

Revisit beginner footwork and distance to avoid “false reactions” mistaken for real reading.

### Qualification Criteria
- Opponent strikes first more frequently
- Can anticipate several possible opponent action paths
- Counterplay appears reliably, not by chance

### Key to Progression
True understanding:  
Victory is not decided at the moment of striking, but shaped by stance, rhythm, and structural layout beforehand.  
Transition from “waiting for opportunity” to **actively compressing possibilities**.

## Advanced Stage

### Stage Characteristics
- Minimal reliance on reactive improvisation
- Clear pre-strike expectation of possible outcomes
- Opponent increasingly awkward, unable to enter familiar rhythm
- Use structure to secure predictable results
- Actively induce opponent commitment, continuously compressing choices
- Psychological play exists, but always based on body structure and spatial control (psychology is a byproduct of structural compression)

### Training Focus
Concentrate on:
- Rhythm management
- Choice compression

Through stance, sword lines, and rhythm changes, reduce opponent options **before striking**, and switch precisely between stable and explosive states.

Against trap-savvy opponents, use distance control and counter-induction to amplify their anxiety and misjudgment.

### Qualification Criteria
- Opponent hesitates, over-defends, or acts impulsively
- Victory occurs logically, not by brute force or luck
- Control dominates the process, not reactive brawling

### Key to Mastery: System Compatibility
At this stage, students are no longer limited to a single style.  
They can freely integrate strengths from different systems based on opponent, environment, and personal state:

- Stable observation and inducement → return to Ear-Guard Plow  
- Precision hunting → Anger Hunt  
- Explosive decisive strike → High-position Anger Strike  
- Opponent exposes upper guard or rhythm disrupted → Apply specific techniques (e.g., Anton methods)  
- Cross-pressure situations → Apply Cross-Strikes (e.g., Fama)  
- Maintaining distance → Harass with Long Point

All techniques operate within the same structural framework, allowing natural, seamless transitions.

**True mark of an advanced practitioner**:  
Not the number of techniques mastered, but a **stable and flexible core structure** unifying strengths from multiple systems.

**System compatibility is the key to reaching the pinnacle.**

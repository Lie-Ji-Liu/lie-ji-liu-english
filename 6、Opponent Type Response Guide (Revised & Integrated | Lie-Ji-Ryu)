# Opponent Type Response Guide (Revised & Integrated | Lie-Ji-Ryu)
## 📜 Guide Usage Philosophy

> This guide provides a framework for **decision-making logic and tactical thinking**, not a rigid, step-by-step procedure to be followed without deviation.

- **Theory is the map, practice is the terrain.**  
  No map, however precise, can depict every minor contour of the land. Treat the "opponent types" described here as typical topographical features, not an exhaustive catalog.

- **Your own body is the ultimate variable.**  
  The feasibility, speed, and linking of all actions must be calibrated through your personal physicality, muscle memory, and instinctive reactions. **In safe training, you must explore the "physical version" of these concepts that works for you.**

- **The goal is to "form your own intuition."**  
  Through repeated study of this guide coupled with practice, the ultimate objective is to reach a point in combat where you can **forget the steps**, yet **respond with** actions that are unique to you and coherent with the guide's logic. When you achieve this, you will no longer need to "consult" the guide.

*Please read with a critical mind, and complete the final verification in actual practice.*

## Chapter Purpose

This chapter aims to help practitioners map Lie-Ji-Ryu action chains to **different opponent behavior styles**, providing a complete decision process:  

**Read opponent → Maintain invincibility → Accumulate advantage → Capture victory window → Securely finish.**

The core goal of Lie-Ji-Ryu is not quick scoring, but:

> **First establish an invincible position, then secure victory under low-risk conditions.**

All strategies herein prioritize **structure, risk control, and clear withdrawal paths**.

## General Execution Principles (Applicable to All Opponents)

### Initial Setup & Reading

- **Unified Start:**  
  Always begin from the stable **Ear-Guard Plow** stance, regardless of opponent type.
- **Reading Method:**  
  Use small forward steps and feints (centerline feints / line-deceiving thrusts) to probe.
- **Reading Duration:**  
  Typically **3–5 beats** to judge opponent rhythm, commitment, and spatial preferences.

> **[Calibration Note | Avoid Over-Cautiousness]**  
> “Invincibility-oriented” does not mean inactivity.  
> If multiple probes fail to exert any structural pressure on the opponent,  
> you have not yet entered the “advantage accumulation stage.”  
> Adjust distance, footwork, or rhythm instead of indefinitely staying in stable stance.

---

### Withdrawal Priority (Highest)

- During any action chain, **immediately return to stable stance** if any occur:
  - Sword tip off-line
  - Hand positions lose close protection
  - Footing unstable or steps interrupted

> **[Calibration Note | Hit-and-Retreat Premise]**  
> “Hit-and-retreat” applies only if structure remains intact at the moment of contact.  
> If hitting compromises your own structure, prioritize structural recovery over retreat.

---

### Opponent Type Usage Note

> **[Calibration Note | Avoid Type Labeling]**  
> Opponent types are not fixed labels; they reflect **current behavioral patterns**.  
> Under pressure, any opponent may switch style.  
> If diagnostic signals change, return to the reading phase immediately.

## Lie-Ji-Ryu General Victory Logic (Three Phases)

1. **Invincibility Phase:**  
   Maintain stable stance, complete reading, avoid being breached.
2. **Advantage Accumulation Phase:**  
   Use rhythm, space, or decision pressure to force opponent into discomfort.
3. **Victory Window Phase:**  
   Execute a short, low-risk finishing strike when the opponent is forced to escalate.

> **[Calibration Note | Victory Window Timing]**  
> Victory windows typically last only **0.5–1 beat**.  
> If repeated confirmation is required, the window has closed; return to stable stance.

# Common Opponent Types & Response Process

All types follow the same sequence:  
**Reading → Invincibility Key → Advantage Accumulation → Victory Window → Finish Execution**

---

## 1. Trap-Inducing Opponent

(Feigns openings to lure mistakes)

**Reading Features**  
- Fake retreats, feigned openings, blade feints  
- Appears slow but counterattacks precisely  
- Rarely fully commits to offense

**Invincibility Key**  
- Do not chase “free” openings  
- Pause observation after a single probe

**Advantage Accumulation**  
- Multiple feints and false advances without following up  
- Allow their inducements to fail, increasing decision pressure

**Victory Window**  
- Opponent forced to commit after failed inducement  
- Or real forward pressure or line exposure during fake retreat

**Finish Execution**  
- Immediate control thrust or counter (see Action Chains A / C)  
- Hit and retreat; do not extend

---

## 2. Rapid Offense Opponent

(High speed, continuous pressure)

**Reading Features**  
- Few pauses, high-frequency thrusts/slashes  
- Actively compresses distance

**Invincibility Key**  
- Do not match their continuous pace  
- Use intercepting thrusts and line control to break rhythm

**Advantage Accumulation**  
- Repeatedly disrupt their initial attacks  
- Force repeated reconstruction of actions

**Victory Window**  
- After rhythm disruption, exploit forced continuation  
- Or capitalize on exposed structure from impatience

**Finish Execution**  
- Short counter-pressure (1–3 beats, see Anger Hunt)  
- Strike → open line → hit and retreat

---

## 3. Passive Counter-Strike Opponent

(Waits for you to make mistakes)

**Reading Features**  
- Frequent retreats or low guard  
- Rarely initiates attacks

**Invincibility Key**  
- Avoid high-commitment strikes  
- Always preserve withdrawal path

**Advantage Accumulation**  
- Small forward steps + feints  
- Induce early exposure of counter intentions

**Victory Window**  
- Mistake feint as real attack  
- Counter prematurely or with exaggerated motion

**Finish Execution**  
- Immediate counter (control thrust / instant slash, see Action Chains A / G)  
- No follow-up

---

## 4. Grappling / Close-Quarters Opponent

(Sticky blade, close-range engagement)

**Reading Features**  
- Does not withdraw after blade contact  
- Prefers pushing and close engagement

**Invincibility Key**  
- Avoid lingering in contact zone  
- Any contact exceeding 2 beats → retreat

**Advantage Accumulation**  
- Multiple “contact-and-retreat” drills  
- Sap their intent to stay close

**Victory Window**  
- Next approach overextends forward pressure  
- Or sacrifices line control for engagement

**Finish Execution**  
- Flip or line-controlled immediate counter (see Action Chains D / Abnehmen)  
- Hit and disengage

---

## 5. Sidestepping / Evasive Opponent

(Maintains distance, avoids direct engagement)

**Reading Features**  
- Constant lateral steps or retreats  
- Rarely commits in a straight line

**Invincibility Key**  
- Do not chase  
- Use stance and footwork to control time

**Advantage Accumulation**  
- Long Point stance forward pressure  
- Continuously compress their usable space

**Victory Window**  
- Forced to edge or rhythm dead-end  
- Compelled into straight-line entry or preemptive strike

**Finish Execution**  
- Instant arcing counter (see Action Chains C / H)  
- Hit and retreat, reset position

---

## Philosophical Reminder

> Lie-Ji-Ryu does not pursue quick victory, only victory without failure.  
> Most wins come not from combination attacks, but from accurately recognizing and executing **victory windows**.  
> If the window does not appear, maintaining invincibility itself is already an advantage.

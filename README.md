# Personal Longsword Notes & Exploratory Framework

**— Documenting my exploration, for reference and discussion, feedback from HEMA enthusiasts welcome**

---

## Overview

This repository documents my **personal exploration of HEMA longsword principles and practices**. It is **not a formal HEMA school or system**, but rather a collection of notes, ideas, and experiments from my own practice. Readers can treat this as reference material, inspiration, or casual reading, and should approach it critically.

The framework integrates **stable state (control-oriented)** and **explosive state (opportunity-oriented)** approaches, emphasizing **flexibility, safety, and priority on control**, aiming for low-risk, efficient engagement with the longsword.

   - **Intermediate**: control center line and distance, read opponent reactions, start incorporating counter-strikes
   - **Advanced**: strong sense of rhythm, ability to compress the engagement space, pre-plan multiple options, flowing stances
   - **Mastery**: integration of various HEMA approaches, absorbing strengths of multiple systems, continuous learning

6. **Opponent Types & Response**

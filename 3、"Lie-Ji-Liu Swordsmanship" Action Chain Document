## I. Overview: Dynamic Action Chain System Rooted in Ear Guard Plow Base

### 1. Core Positioning of Ear Guard Plow Base (Must Understand First)

**Ear Guard Plow Base is not purely defensive, nor passively waiting.**  
It is a relay position centered on stability, **defense-first but retaining offensive outlets**. Its core functions are:

- Absorb part of your reaction cost  
- Simplify engagement complexity  
- Create low-risk offensive openings under safety  

Think of it as your **"home."**  
You can step out to act, but always retreat safely back.

The basic pattern for all action chains is:

> Return home → Observe → Actively or passively create a problem → Switch tools/stances or perform low-risk attack → Return home

Only when you clearly gain **Vor (first-strike advantage)** is it allowed to **not immediately return home**, but to engage further.

### 2. Three Layers of Structural Advantage Provided by Ear Guard Plow Base

① **Sword Point on Line (Middle-Lower Line)**

- Natural threat to middle line thrust  
- Shortest path for active thrusts and interception  
- Automatically blocks low and upward thrust lines  

② **Hands Close to Body**

- Short sword path  
- Easier to form **Bind** after active thrust  
- Low reaction cost to switch to Suspended / Long Point / Plow Stances  

③ **Plow-style Stable Lower Body**

- Footwork can advance, retreat, or lateral  
- Failed attack still allows withdrawal  
- Single misjudgment will not compromise position  

> These three points are not about "making you stronger," but about **reducing fatal mistakes when attacking**.

## II. Offensive Nature of Ear Guard Plow Base (Must Explain in Teaching)

### 1. Offensive Positioning

**Ear Guard Plow Base can attack, but not as primary intent.**  
Its attacks are:

- Low-risk  
- Low-commitment  
- Interruptible at any time  

Purpose is not to score forcibly, but to:

- Test opponent reactions  
- Occupy or confirm middle line  
- Force opponent to reveal intent  

### 2. Three Acceptable Active Attack Types

#### Attack A｜Linear Thrust → Bind

**Purpose**

- Active blade contact  
- Establish **Bind** to read reactions  

**Key Requirements**

- Small thrust amplitude  
- Do not overcommit weight  
- Bind forms naturally; hit is secondary  

**Withdrawal Principle**

- Return to stable state if line not gained  

#### Attack B｜Feint / Reaction Forcing

**Purpose**

- Induce opponent to parry or change line  
- Create informational advantage for next beat  

**Common Forms**

- Feint middle line, true outside  
- Feint high, true front hand  

**Teaching Note**

- Feint is not for hitting, but to **make opponent move**  

#### Attack C｜Steal Hand (Conditional)

**Purpose**

- Punish opponent exposing front hand during defense  

**Prerequisites**

- Distance controlled by stable state  
- Opponent focused on middle or high line  

**Risk Note**

- Greedy attempt leads to instability  

> **General Principle:** Ear Guard Plow Base attacks **never risk life**.

## III. Ear Guard Plow Base vs Fury Hunt: Attack Authority Comparison (Final Puzzle)

> This section is **not a technical manual**, but must be taught for “authority boundaries.”

### 1. Core Distinction in One Sentence

- **Ear Guard Plow Base:** I can probe, but do not commit result  
- **Fury Hunt:** I commit result, either score or withdraw  

### 2. Attack Authority Comparison Table

| Dimension | Ear Guard Plow Base | Fury Hunt |
|-----------|------------------|-----------|
| Attack Purpose | Probe / Force reaction / Info gathering | Score / Suppress / Terminate |
| Allowed to initiate thrust | ✅ Yes (low commitment) | ✅ Yes (high commitment) |
| Allowed to Bind | ✅ Yes (read reaction) | ✅ Yes (convert advantage) |
| Allowed to chain attacks | ❌ Not recommended | ✅ Yes |
| Allowed to risk life | ❌ Explicitly forbidden | ⚠️ Conditional |
| Default post-failure | Return to stable state | Withdraw or strong control |

### 3. Why Some Attacks Must Wait for Fury Hunt

The following **should not** be performed in Ear Guard Plow Base:

- Multiple chained beats  
- Obvious forward overcommitment  
- Engagements aimed at suppression  

Reason: **Failure cost too high; must perform in stance committed to attack.**

### 4. Key Teaching Reminder (Original Wording Recommended)

> **If you intend to be responsible for this beat, switch to Fury Hunt;  
> If you hesitate, stay in Ear Guard Plow Base.**

## IV. Stance Switching Teaching Logic (Very Important)

**Stance switching is a change in tactical intent, not just motion.**  

Decision order:

1. What problem did the opponent create?  
2. What is my biggest current risk?  
3. Which stance is the "specialized tool"?

| Tactical Need | Suitable Stance Switch | Notes |
|---------------|----------------------|-------|
| Defend high cuts / react immediately | Suspended (Hanging) Stance | Specialized defense-counter tool |
| Control time / middle line | Long Point | Extend control, preserve stable state |
| Strengthen close-sword defense | Plow Stance | Stabilize middle line, prevent charge |
| Force immediate response | Fury Hunt | Explosive state, conditional |
| Gamble for decisive hit | Bull / High Line | High-risk, not recommended frequently |

## V. Core Action Chains (By Problem)

### [Problem 1] Opponent High Cut (Vom Tag / Donna)

#### Tactical Principle

**Use straight line to hit curve.**  
Goal: not hard block, but make attack **just miss**.

#### Action Chain A｜Control-Thrust Counter (Preferred)

**Trigger Conditions**

- Mid distance  
- Opponent’s cut trajectory complete, not close  

**Key Points**

1. Small backward/side step to open line  
2. Sword line unchanged; no large parry  
3. Linear thrust to arm or torso  
4. Conditional Bind to feel blade reaction  
5. If no advantage, return to Ear Guard Plow Base  

**Suitable For**

- Beginners  
- Structural sense not mature  

**Risk**

- Chasing after thrust → vulnerable to line change counter  

#### Action Chain B｜Suspended Stance Immediate Counter (Close Range)

**Trigger**

- Close distance, retreat risky  

**Key Points**

1. Raise sword → switch to Suspended Stance  
2. Instant counter (Indes) at contact  
3. No follow-up, return to stable  

**Suitable For**

- Those with distance judgment  

**Risk**

- Delay → becomes hard block  

#### Action Chain C｜Bull Stance Linear Thrust (Clear Vor)

**Trigger**

- Opponent initiating high cut  
- Clear first-strike advantage (Vor)  
- Mid-close distance  

**Key Points**

1. Switch to high stance (Bull / Roof)  
2. Use strong part of sword to cover opponent’s weak part  
3. Linear thrust into middle or high line  
4. Hit → withdraw, miss → do not pursue  

**Suitable For**

- Vor judgment clear  

**Risk**

- Wrong Vor → enter full exchange  

### [Problem 2] Opponent Mid Thrust (Middle Line Contest)

#### Tactical Principle

**Middle line is not seized, but taken.**

#### Action Chain D｜Deflect → Linear Thrust

**Trigger**

- Sword tips close  
- Opponent linear thrust  

**Key Points**

1. Small circular deflection  
2. Goal: prevent continuation, not knockout  
3. Immediate linear thrust  
4. Return to stable  

**Teaching Focus**

- Deflection = control, not kill  

#### Action Chain E｜Intercept Thrust (Opponent Initiates)

**Trigger**

- Opponent advances thrust  
- Distance not close  

**Key Points**

1. Tip stays on line  
2. No parry, no circling  
3. Intercept on line  
4. Hit or force back → return stable  

**Suitable For**

- Those confident in timing/distance  

**Risk**

- Too slow → becomes bind  

#### Action Chain F｜Suspended Block Counter (Mid Thrust Variation)

**Trigger**

- Thrust with line change or pressure  
- Deflect risk high  

**Key Points**

1. Raise sword → Suspended stance occupies line  
2. Use structure to block  
3. Use Indes to counter  
4. No follow, return stable  

**Suitable For**

- Familiar with Suspended stance structure  

**Risk**

- Excessive sword raise → line change vulnerability  

#### Failure Branch｜Deflect Pressed → Abnehmen Withdrawal

**Signal**

- Sword pressed down  
- Opponent keeps advancing  

**Key Points**

1. Do not resist, let force guide (Abnehmen)  
2. Side-step to open middle line  
3. Return Ear Guard Plow Base  

**Core Insight**

> If you cannot control, do not strike.

### [Problem 3] Opponent Low Guard (Alber)

#### Tactical Principle

**Force them to move, do not move for them.**

#### Action Chain G｜Pressure → Force Mistake

**Trigger**

- Opponent in low guard  

**Key Points**

1. Small forward step, tip stays on line  
2. No active attack, compress distance  
3. Wait for upper/lunge attempt  
4. Downward control → thrust → return stable  

**Advantage**

- Naturally counters low structure  

#### Action Chain H｜Compressed Step → Direct Thrust

**Trigger**

- Distance compressed to safe range  
- Opponent slow to react  

**Key Points**

1. Step forward keeping tip on line  
2. Do not wait, straight thrust  
3. Hit → withdraw, miss → do not pursue  

**Suitable For**

- Mature distance judgment  

**Risk**

- Insufficient compression → eat upward thrust

## VI. Fury Hunt Action Chains (Conditional Module)

### Positioning

**Fury Hunt is not routine attack.**  
It is the “precision assault” when deciding to forcibly open the situation.

### Activation Conditions (Any Two)

- Opponent continuously retreats  
- Sword tip wobbles, losing middle line  
- You step forward → opponent can only retreat  

### Core Action Chain

1. Switch from Ear Guard Plow Base → Fury Hunt  
2. Continuous leap-step forward pressure (foot first, sword not rushing)  
3. **First strike options (choose based on reaction):**  
   - **Lateral Swipe**: quick horizontal hit to opponent’s blade, open line  
   - **Fury Thrust**: straight-line thrust into middle line, force defense  
4. **Post-Strike Extension (Conditional)**  
   - Hit / clear line: Bind to feel reaction, then press or withdraw  
   - Blade-on-blade without hit: maintain Bind, **circle around same-side slash**  

**Three Branch Judgments**

- **A｜Blade controlled** → forward step to finish, or strike/thrust in Bind  
- **B｜Bind stalemate** → maintain short-term Bind, decide whether to continue engagement  
- **C｜Opponent counter** → immediately sidestep, no life-risk  

**Termination Principle**

- Hit → withdraw immediately  
- Lose control → withdraw immediately  

---

## VII. “Monster Module” (Non-Teaching Solution)

**Positioning**  
Only exists when:

- Distance unrecoverable  
- All structural judgment fails  

**Teaching Attitude**  
> Know it exists, do not use in routine training.

---

## VIII. Ultimate Summary

- Low level: obsess over which technique is stronger  
- Mid level: use actions to solve problems  
- High level: **use Ear Guard Plow Base to decide whether to strike, when, and how without loss**  

### One-Sentence Principle

> Root in Ear Guard Plow Base, read the situation, use the right tool, act without loss.

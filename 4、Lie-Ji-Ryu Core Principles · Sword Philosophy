# Lie-Ji-Ryu Core Principles · Sword Philosophy

> The art of the sword is not about winning a single encounter, but about seeking the path of invincibility.  
> The essence of Lie-Ji-Ryu lies not in harming the enemy, but in first rendering oneself unbeatable, then exploiting the enemy's vulnerability.

**Seek**: the effectiveness of a single strike, executed correctly.  
**Abandon**: chained gains, with risky maneuvers.  
**Guard**: one's own safety, using stillness to control motion.

## I. Four Mechanisms of Combat · Evolution of Battle Flow

Battle flow is like water—ever-changing—but its mechanisms can be observed, and its currents directed. Lie-Ji-Ryu identifies four mechanisms, which cycle repeatedly.

### Waiting Mechanism (S0)
**Form**: No engagement yet, like a calm deep pool or a towering mountain. Sword tip points at the throat; stance steady, center of gravity solid.  
**Intent**: Wait at ease. This is not passivity; rather, it is using stillness to control motion and compress the opponent’s initiative. Like laying a net for a flying bird.  
**Transition**: If the enemy probes or retreats in hesitation, the mechanism changes.

### Locking Mechanism (S1)
**Form**: You have taken the initiative, preempting the opponent. Sword slightly pressing, like a floodgate stopping water.  
**Intent**: Render oneself invincible while waiting for the enemy to become vulnerable. Do not attack blindly; draw boundaries to funnel the opponent into your setup.  
**Caution**: Avoid entanglement, greed, or distraction.

### Decisive Mechanism (S2)
**Form**: The enemy's momentum is fully expended; new energy has not yet formed. You strike like lightning, hitting the opening.  
**Intent**: Strike after preparation, first and foremost. Shortest path, focused mind, like a hawk diving for a rabbit.  
**Outcome**: Hit → inflict decisive effect; Miss → enter recovery state.

### Residual / Escape Mechanism (S3 / S4)
**Residual (S3)**: Strike lands. Do not watch the result; do not pause. Immediately return to base stance, like tide receding. This is the path of total victory, leaving no opportunity for the enemy.  

**Escape (S4)**: Strike misses; enemy counterattacks. Prefer losing positional advantage rather than risking life. Abandon the center, relinquish initiative, and retreat to preserve overall safety for the next opportunity.

## II. Three Doctrines · Mental Discipline

In combat, the mind can be chaotic. Following these three doctrines in order ensures safety and decisiveness:

1. **Doctrine of Life Preservation**: Can this action risk mutual harm? If yes, forbid it. A single life is invaluable.  
2. **Doctrine of Exposure**: Does this action leave my vital center (midline) unprotected? If yes, forbid it. Only full protection enables control.  
3. **Doctrine of Hesitation**: Does this action require deliberation before execution? If yes, forbid it. Speed is crucial; hesitation breeds danger.

Only after all three doctrines are satisfied may you execute a decisive strike.

Thus, Lie-Ji-Ryu appears slow, but is actually steady; appears yielding, but is thoroughly complete.

## III. Principles of Force · Counter and Natural Law

**Against a strong opponent**: If the enemy also understands this approach, do not rush. Victory may be decided in millimeters, but you have already established an unassailable position.

**When rules are unfavorable**: If the system rewards risk and punishes caution, behave like driftwood in water—adapt. You can sharpen your edge without compromising structural stability; even if victory is hard, defeat is unlikely.

**Ultimate state**: Lie-Ji-Ryu does not aim for certain victory but for a foundation of invincibility.  
Thus, a true warrior has no need for fame or brute courage. Victory lies in exploiting the easy paths.  
When rules bend in your favor, you have touched the root of swordsmanship.

**Saying**:  
Move swiftly without haste, weigh without contest.  
Exploit your stability, await enemy chaos.  
Exploit your gaps-free stance, await enemy openings.  
This is the essence of the Lie-Ji sword.

## Lie-Ji-Ryu Practical Mindset · Plain Version

**Core idea**: Fight smart, avoid losing trades.

Martial arts is not about risking life, but about strategic game theory.  
The goal is not how severely you injure your opponent, but how consistently you maintain advantage.  
Every strike must be calculated: do I gain from this move, or does he? If it risks loss, or is merely neutral, it is better not to act.

### Four Mental States (Always aware like a mirror)

1. **Observe and Wait**  
   Safe distance; apply pressure like water, compressing space. Sword tip points at weaknesses, but do not strike. Make the opponent impatient first.

2. **Lock the Path**  
   Read the opponent’s intent; block attack routes. They risk everything if they act. Maintain composure; avoid entanglement or greed.

3. **Strike Decisively**  
   Enemy acts, old technique unrecoverable. Strike like lightning: shortest path, no hesitation. Seek efficiency and safety.

4. **Withdraw**  
   Hit → retreat immediately; do not admire your work.  
   Miss → retreat promptly; preserve yourself for the next opportunity.

### Iron Rules (Order cannot be broken)

1. Could this strike lead to mutual harm? Stop if yes.  
2. Does this expose my vital center? Stop if yes.  
3. Need to improvise or delay? Stop if yes.  
4. Passed all above → guaranteed gain? If yes, act decisively.

Practice simplifies movement; even conservative actions apply immense psychological pressure. Opponents find their usual tactics useless or dangerous.

**Summary**: Lie-Ji-Ryu trains “control of the field”, guiding confrontation into your most familiar and safe rhythm.  
Master this, and victory is determined before the first strike.

## Lie-Ji-Ryu Mindset · Anger Hunt Edition

**Core essence unchanged**: Gain advantage without risky trades.  
Now, let the opponent feel the pressure behind your calmness.

### Core Principle: Anger Hunt Stance

Observation (S0) is not passive; it is **active and threatening stillness**.

- Eyes like a hawk: focused, decisive.  
- Breathing long and low: storing energy, not lax.  
- Footwork steady, advancing like tides: compressing the opponent’s space.  
- Essence: apply pressure. Make the opponent err under fear of instant counterattack.

### Four-State Cycle, Pressing Continuously

1. **Anger Hunt (S0 Advanced)**: Control field, disturb opponent’s mind.  
2. **Lock Paths (S1)**: Once opponent panics and exposes lines, lock all comfortable attack channels.  
3. **Instant Strike (S2)**: When opponent is forced to act, strike decisively. This is the result of pressure.  
4. **Return / Retreat (S3 / S4)**: Hit → reset to Anger Hunt; Miss → retreat, regroup. Repeat cycle.

### Iron Rules and Flexibility

The **Three No-Rules** remain:  

1. No risking life  
2. No exposing vital center  
3. No hesitation  

For extreme cases, the **Monster Module** exists as a last-resort gamble.

#### Monster Module · Desperate Gambit

A non-standard option for critical moments; breaks conventional Lie-Ji-Ryu safety rules.  

**Situations**:

- Prolonged defense failing; trapped in corner.  
- Opponent reads and adapts to your usual rhythm.  
- Need a high-risk shock to tip the balance.

**Examples**:

- Deceptive footwork: unconventional steps to disrupt distance.  
- Close-range grappling: abandon sword advantage; use throws or entanglement.

**Warning**: Using this module can destabilize yourself.  
Use only when orthodox methods guarantee failure.

### Final Words

The ultimate mastery is to pressure the opponent using only **Anger Hunt** and **Ear-Guard Plow** stances. The **Monster Module** should rarely, if ever, be used.

Your strength lies in choice: **gain with precision, win with cunning**.  
Your opponent will never predict your next move.

**This concludes the Mindset section.**
